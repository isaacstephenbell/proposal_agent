### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Start the system
npm run dev
# ‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.2.7 - Local: http://localhost:3000

# Test methodology synthesis (WORKING):
# "Can you tell me how we approach segmentation studies typically?"
# ‚Üí Should return synthesized methodology with unified approach

# Test follow-up conversations (IN PROGRESS):
# Follow previous query with: "what about pricing for those studies?"
# ‚Üí Currently experiencing detection issues, fixes applied but needs final debug

# Other working consultant query types:
# "How do we typically approach organizational change?"
# "What deliverables do we provide for strategic planning?"
# "Have we done digital transformation for technology clients?"
```
