# üéØ Proposal UX Flow System

## Complete Implementation Guide

This document outlines the complete proposal creation UX flow system that has been implemented, providing multiple entry points and a seamless user experience.

## üè† System Overview

The system consists of four main components that work together to create a comprehensive proposal creation experience:

- **usage_analytics** - Block usage tracking

## üé® Design Principles

### 1. Flexible Entry Points
- Users can start anywhere in the system
- No forced workflows or rigid paths
- Multiple ways to achieve the same goal

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Information revealed as needed
- Complex features hidden until relevant
- Gradual complexity introduction

### 3. Contextual Intelligence
- System learns from user behavior
- Smart suggestions based on current work
- Context preservation across flows

### 4. Compound Value
- System gets smarter with use
- Reusable blocks improve over time
- Analytics drive better suggestions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Development Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Apply blocks schema
supabase db push
```

### 3. Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

### 4. First Use
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` ‚Üí Redirects to Dashboard
2. Explore the three main entry points
3. Create your first proposal using any flow
4. Save content sections as blocks
5. See suggestions improve over time

## üîç Key Features

### Smart Block Suggestions
